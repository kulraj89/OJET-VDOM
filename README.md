## Introduction
Oracle JET using the Virtual DOM (VDOM) architecture and integrate OCI Vision services for enhanced functionality.
Oracle JET VDOM Vision service response application
This code for Oracle JET Virtual DOM Architecture based applications.
This project is developed for use with the Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit(JET) coding environment.


## Getting Started

There are three parts of the application. The code for part 3 is in this repository.

• Part 1: Upload  images to OCI bucket.

1.	Login to your Oracle Cloud Account. If you don't have one yet, sign up at cloud.oracle.com.
2.	Create a compartment from the OCI “Identity and Security” menu and note the CompartmentID.
3.	From the Storage menu, choose the “Bucket” option. Create a bucket the compartment you created above and name it “ORACLE_DEMO_BUCKET” .
4.	Upload sample images.
5.	Set up an API signing key and OCI profile mentioned in  OCI documentation.

• Part 2: Integration of OCI Java SDK with OCI Vision service to handle image processing within a Spring Boot application. 

  •	Clone the repository below and follow its instructions to run the code locally.

• Part 3: Developing an Oracle JET (VDOM) application to consume and display the results from OCI Vision Service.
	Clone the repository below and execute the command below in the local terminal.
    
        
                    npx ojet serve
**The final application should look as follows on a localhost server:**
Our blog will feature a one-page application with Object Storage Details and OCI Vision Result sections. In the Object Storage Details section, users enter Tenancy Region and Bucket Name. After validating the inputs, the application fetches the images stored in the provided object storage, which are then displayed in object lists. Upon submission, the OCI Vision API analyzes the selected image, displaying both the object and text in the OCI Vision Result section.
